### What is the purpose of this repository
This repository was created with the intention of teaching and co-building with a group of colleagues a simple bot made for Discord. Therefore, the code will be quite simple, but don't misjudge it, for sure it have been really fun to put it all up.

### Built with
- [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome)

### Now that we are ready to go, let's start coding!
This tutorial will get you a start on the project. But don't limit yourself to just that. Keep searching and trying to evolve your skills!

#### First steps
- Start a Node project by using `yarn init -y` on your terminal. Then, you should have a file named `package.json`. After it you might be able to install the actual library that we'll be using.
- Again at the terminal type `yarn add discord.js`, this can take a bit of time, depending on your internet connection.
